# eeglib

A collection of tools for loading and analyzing EEG data. Primarily these are
tools used by me to do quick spot checks of data. For more complex analysis,
please consider other libraries such as:

* [PTSA](http://ptsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [MNE](http://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html)
* [EEGtools](https://github.com/breuderink/eegtools)
